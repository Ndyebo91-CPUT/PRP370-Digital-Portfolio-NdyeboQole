- **Task**: Conduct a personality assessment to gain clarity on my professional strengths and preferences.
- **Action**: On February 17, 2025, I took part in a workshop, finished a personality test (which revealed that I favor structure), wrote notes on my findings, and talked with peers about how this affects teamwork.
- **Result**:  I became more comfortable using my methodical approach in projects, realised that I needed to be more adaptable, and made plans to emphasise my organizing abilities in my resume and in future team positions.
